            Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent
            accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving.
            The objective of this intermediate Python project is to build a
            drowsiness detection system that will detect that a personâ€™s eyes
            are closed for a few seconds. This system will alert the driver when
            drowsiness is detected
